        <div id="paragraph1">21 years ago on March, 1996 Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification was
            published. So what's an Internet Protocol, and what's wrong with the previous five versions? And if version
            6 is so great, why has it only been adopted by half a percent of the Internet's users each year over the
            past two decades?<br/>
            There are a lot of definitions of IP, but this is one is most understandable to me:
            The Internet Protocol (IP) is the method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on
            the Internet. Each computer (known as a host) on the Internet has at least one IP address that uniquely
            identifies it from all other computers on the Internet.

            <h3>Why to use IPv6?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>IPv6 has massive address abundance</li>
                <li>IPv6 networks are easier and cheaper to manage</li>
                <li>IPv6 restores end-to-end transparency</li>
                <li>IPv6 has improved security features</li>
                <li>IPv6 has improved mobility capabilities</li>
                <li>IPv6 encourages innovation</li>
            </ol>
            IPv6 has been around for two decades now. So why are we still measuring IPv6 deployment in percentage points
            per year?<br/>

            First the good news. On Saturday 03 November 2017, Google's statistics show IPv6 availability to
            approximately 20% of its users. It is used more on weekends and adoption is uneven across countries and
            Internet service providers. Apparently more people have IPv6 available at home than at work.<br/>

            In November 2016, 1491 (98.2%) of the 1519 top-level domains (TLDs) in the Internet supported IPv6 to access
            their domain name servers, and 1485 (97.8%) zones contained IPv6 glue records, and approximately 9.0 million
            domains (4.6%) had IPv6 address records in their zones. Of all networks in the global BGP routing table,
            29.2% had IPv6 protocol support.

        <div id="paragraph3">
            <h3>5 reasons why the adoption of IPv6 takes so long:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It's bloody expensive<br/>
                    The internet is made up of millions of routers and switches. Those were initially designed to work
                    with IPv4. Replacing or upgrading them takes time and budget.
                </li>

                <li>Network address translation (NAT) to the rescue<br/>
                    The IPv4 address exhaustion was the major driver to develop IPv6.
                </li>

                <li>Compatibility please!<br/>
                    During the design of the IPv6 protocol, backward compatibility was not on the requirements list.
                    This lack of compatibility with the current IPv4 protocol was the single critical failure. Because
                    of this, the transition towards IPv6 does not provide a single, standardized solution to communicate
                    with devices and systems that still run IPv4.
                </li>


                <li>I will not do it if you don't<br/>
                    There is no direct benefit of being an early adopter. Nobody will switch to IPv6 as long as none of
                    their contacts is switching too.
                </li>

                <li>It doesn't reach the eye<br/>
                    While the adoption of IPv6 goes much slower than initially planned, the transition is already taking
                    place. At this point, somewhere between 18 to 20 percent of traffic reaching Google is IPv6 traffic.

            <h3>At the end</h3>
            As noted, networks worldwide are in the process of turning IPv6 on, and some are in the process of turning
            IPv4 off. IPv6 has been a “future” since 1998, and an important future since 2007. It is now becoming a
            present-day reality. If a 67 percent increase per year is the new normal, it'll take until summer 2020 until
            the entire world has IPv6 and we can all stop slicing and dicing our diminishing stashes of IPv4 addresses.
            The hardest part of any journey is proverbially the first step, and not taking that step merely delays the
            pain and the costs involved.
