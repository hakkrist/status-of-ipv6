# The Status of IPv6

The Status of IPv6 is a project idea that was born at the RIPE NCC IPv6 Hackathon in Copenhagen. The participants worked two days (and one night) on gathering data that can provide an unbiased view on the adoption of IPv6. 

The project is far from finished but we hope that what is already there is useful and that we will be able to extend this project.
